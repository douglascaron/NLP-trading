# NLP-trading
2023-2025 CS NEA

This project is a CS A-level NEA which uses FinBERT AI model to trade based on fyinance news

The frontend will be a website over an application as it is easier to make it cross platform and more accessible.it accessible to a wider audience and to ensure compatibility across different devices and platforms. Additionally, a website allows for easy deployment and updates without the need for users to manually install and update an application.

To create the frontend website, we can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML will be used for structuring the content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic functionality.

We can use modern web development frameworks and libraries such as React or Vue.js to simplify the development process and enhance the user experience. These frameworks provide reusable components, state management, and routing capabilities.

To fetch and display financial data, we can use APIs such as yfinance to retrieve stock market data and display it in charts. We can also use the FinBERT AI model from Hugging Face to analyze finance news and make trading decisions based on the sentiment analysis.

For charting, we can use lightweight charting libraries like Lightweight Charts from TradingView. These libraries provide interactive and responsive charts that can be easily integrated into the website.

To enhance the user interface and user experience, we can take inspiration from existing websites such as AILab Telkom and MLEM.AI. These websites showcase modern design trends and provide a visually appealing and intuitive user interface.

For design inspiration, we can also refer to websites like Minimal Gallery, Dark Mode Design, Awwwards, Refero Design, and Stacksorted. These websites showcase creative and innovative design concepts that can be incorporated into our frontend.

By combining these technologies and design inspirations, we can create a powerful and user-friendly frontend for our NLP trading application.
