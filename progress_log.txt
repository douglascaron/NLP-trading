Summary of Progress:
I started this project by creating a git repository which will hold all the code for this project. 
I then made the repository local to my machine by cloning it to my machine. 
After this, I created a progress_log.txt file in order to log all the progress I made. After this, although not much was done, and no coding was done, I went to the drawing board and started planning the technicalities of how my project would work.

After this, I started setting up my IDE for my personal preference, configuring things like the theme, font and keyboard shortcuts. I did this so that everythign it setup from the start and I'm able to work more effectively in a familiar environment. For my IDE, I picked visual studio code (also known as vscode) due to my familiarity with it, the fact it's free and because of it's ease of use. It's a very intuitive IDE where everything is easy to learn and understand.

Coding and Testing:
Not much coding was actually done, except for the setting up of the terminal where I created a .bashrc file which is a file ran on terminal startup which I used to customize what the styling looked like in the terminal.
